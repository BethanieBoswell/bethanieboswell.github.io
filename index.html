          <div class="author-text">
            <p>Bethanie Boswell has spent her career striving to fulfill her personal mission to deliver demonstrable value and positive outcomes in every role. During twelve years as a classroom teacher, she listened actively, diagnosed hidden needs, anticipated newcomers’ questions, and developed creative solutions for unique challenges. At Georgia Public Broadcasting, she designed and operated an innovative program bringing emerging tech to thousands of educators and students. Later, as a professional learning specialist, she traveled nationwide to support a new bilingual early literacy program, equipping teachers with the tools and strategies for a successful rollout.</p>

            <p>This focus on building true partnerships where every stakeholder benefits, combined with the realization that a profession existed to blend skills like relationship building, creative problem-solving, project management, and strategic enablement, prompted a deep exploration of the field. The result is <em>Customer Success, Decoded</em>, a product of her focused effort to deconstruct the profession from the valuable perspective of a dedicated newcomer.</p>
